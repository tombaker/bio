Thomas Baker is an independent Semantic Web consultant currently helping FAO
build the Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS).  His background is in
social sciences, with a PhD in Anthropology at Stanford University (1989)
followed by work at a socio-economic research institute in Italy.  Since 1993,
his wife's relocations have taken their family from New York to Bonn, Bangkok,
Berlin, Washington, and back to Bonn, where he currently resides.  Drawn to the
Internet since his time on The WELL, a Bay-area virtual community, he switched
fields, via a masters in library science at Rutgers University, to work at the
German National Research Center for Informatics (GMD).  He has worked at
Goettingen State Library and taught at the Asian Institute of Technology
(Bangkok) and Sungkyunkwan University (Seoul).  Long a member of the DCMI
Directorate, he has consulted on numerous projects, notably related to
professional education (LD4PE Project) and agricultural semantics (AGROVOC and
GACS).  He co-chaired the W3C working group that published Simple Knowledge
Organization System (SKOS), the technical basis for GACS.  An ardent polyglot,
Tom is currently learning Ruby.  Viewing RDF as the language of data, he
advocates for semantic approaches that are multilingually inclusive and
sustainably simple.
